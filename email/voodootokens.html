        <br>
        You called for some (networking) magic, and here's your voodoo
        token: <br>
        <br>
        <b>{insert token}</b><br>

        Some notes on the alpha test...<br>

    <blockquote><font size="+1"><font face="Junicode">1. Full details
          and discussion are found in the <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&amp;t=8845">member


            forum voodoo thread</a> (cryptostorm.org/voodoo), if you'd
          like to go a bit deeper.</font></font><br>

      <font size="+1"><font face="Junicode">2. Config files for voodoo
          sessions are found in the <a

      <font size="+1"><font face="Junicode">3. This is an alpha test, so
          remember not to trust your life to the security of voodoo
          sessions! Run through the <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&amp;t=8845">voodoo


            thread</a> for more backstory and explanation of that
          warning - voodoo works, but it's still in test mode.</font></font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1"><font face="Junicode">4. A voodoo-enabled Windows
          'widget' will be done compiling shortly, and we'll post
          binaries and links to integrity validation tools) in the <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&amp;t=8845">voodoo


            thread</a>. Or keep an eye on the <a
            href="https://twitter.com/cryptohaven">@cryptohaven</a>
          twitter feed, as we'll cross-post any voodoo items there.</font></font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1"><font face="Junicode">5. Your voodoo token is
          totally separate from conventional cryptostorm tokens, and the
          cryptostorm network itself. That's just for the alpha test,
          but for now they are disconnected. We suggest you fiddle with
          the voodoo session and try various network analytic tools
          whilst on-voodoo: note performance, reliability, any problems
          particular applications may have, and so on. </font></font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1"><font face="Junicode">6. We'll be adding
          additional voodoo nodes, with dedicated resolvers, as time
          goes on - and already have several in production. Watch the <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&amp;t=8845">voodoo


            thread</a> for resolver mappings that can be used to test
          out the new voodoo trajectories as they come available.</font></font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1"><font face="Junicode">7. Your voodoo token is
          actually the public key of an ECC (c25519) keypair - which is
          the foundation of <a
            href="https://github.com/cryptostorm/cstorm_tokens2.0">tokens(2)</a>,
          our upgraded token auth system. <a
            href="https://github.com/cryptostorm/cstorm_tokens2.0">Tokens(2)</a>
          is still pre-alpha, but we're using the voodoo alpha test to
          gather early data. If we're ready to test other bits of
          tokens(2) meanwhile, we'll let you know because once that
          happens... your voodoo token will grow wings.</font></font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1"><font face="Junicode">8. Let us know if you'd like
          to claim your voodoo.network email address - we do these
          manually, so it won't be instantaneously configured... but
          we'll get you set up (POP3/IMAP/SMTP). These accounts continue
          in perpetuity, and don't really cost us anything to maintain.

      <font size="+1"><font face="Junicode">9. Let's make voodoo the
          antitode to dragnet surveillance, corruptor-injector attacks,
          and the subjugation of internet freedoms by centralised power
          cliques.</font></font><br>

        We're running the voodoo test manually, to maximise interaction
        with the community and the learning that follows. Feel free to
        email the entire voodoo team within cryptostorm via <a
          href="alpha@voodoo.network">alpha@voodoo.network</a>, &amp;
        we'll get back to you as quick as possible. <br>
        <br>
        Thanks for your support!<br>
        <br>
        Tally ho,<br>
