    <title>welcome to cryptostorm darknet ☔ your network access token</title>
  </head>
  <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000">
    <small><font face="Bitstream Charter"><big>Congrats! :-)<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're the proud owner of a newly-minted
          cryptostorm <a href="http://tokens.cryptostorm.org">network
            access token</a>, duration xx-months. Here is your token:<br>
          <br>
          xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cryptostorm isn't designed like the
          old-style, disloyal "<a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=60&amp;t=92">VPN
            companies</a>" - we've washed away needless <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=64&amp;t=6118">complexity
            &amp; distractions</a>, for a direct focus on network
          security &amp; <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=64&amp;t=4384">cryptographic
            protection</a>. Here's a few things that help folks get
          'on-cstorm' quick &amp; drama-free:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your token is all you use to connect to
          cryptostorm. There's no "account" &amp; no extra info. Don't
          lose your token, as we can't replace it - we delete records of
          sold tokens, permanently. And don't worry about using your
          token right away - it won't begin 'eroding' towards expiration
          until you auth into cryptostorm the first time.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows folks most often use our <a
            href="http://https://github.com/cryptostorm">opensource</a>
          network access 'widget' to connect to cryptostorm. The
          most-recent version is always available <a
            href="http://widget.cryptostorm.org">here</a> &amp; <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.is/connect">here</a>. The widget
          automates most everything involved in making use of
          cryptostorm's service. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until we get the widget ported, members on
          other OSes find their connection tools in our <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewforum.php?f=37">howto
            guides</a> (<a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&amp;t=6158">linux</a>
          | <a

            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&amp;t=6158">OSX</a>),
          or via quick links on our <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.is/connect">connect-info</a> page.
          We support any platform that has enough cryptographic
          foundation to meet the needs of our security model. Most
          connections are quick and easy, right off the bat.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you run into snags, <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=47&amp;t=3075">contact
            us</a> &amp; we'll find a way through to success. Our <a
            href="href=%22https://cryptostorm.org/viewforum.php?f=32">member
            support subforum</a> is a great place to look for quick
          fixes to common issues, &amp; even esoteric topics often find
          expert advice there. We man our support email acccount
          (support@cryptostorm.is) full-schedule, so if it's a few hours
          &amp; you've not heard from us... don't panic! We never leave
          members in the lurch, &amp; we'll be on it as quick a we can.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor speeds, spotty connections, or
          frequent drops are not something you should accept as 'normal'
          whilst on-cstorm! If you have those issues, get in touch &amp;
          we'll figure out what's going on. Often a visit to our <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.nu/webchat">#cryptostorm chatroom</a>
          gets members in touch with others who can help smooth such
          wrinkles. We take <a
            href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=6083">network
            performance</a> very seriously.<br>
          <br>

          this <a href="https://cryptostorm.is/uptime">status page</a>
