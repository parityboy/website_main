    <title>welcome to cryptostorm ☔ a friend gave you a token </a>
  </head>
  <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000">
    <small><font face="Bitstream Charter"><big>Congrats! :-)<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A generous friend has arranged to give you this cstorm <a href="http://cryptostorm.org/tokens">network
            access token</a>  (or, if you sent yourself this token, we'll act like we didn't notice, because... awkward ;-) 
            as part of our <a href="http://cryptopstorm.love">cryptostorm.love</a> celebration. It's duration is xx-months:<br>
          <br>
          xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cryptostorm is much more than an old-style "<a href="http://cleanvpn.org">VPN services</a>" and all the problems they have.
          First, we washed away needless <a href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=64&amp;t=6118">complexity</a> and useless cruft.
           Next, we've integrated groundbreaking security services like our <a href="http://deepdns.net">deepDNS resolver system</a>,
           <a href="http://voodoo.network">multi-tier'voodoo'network topology</a>, and <a href="https://cryptostorm.org/trackersmacker">TrackerSmacker ad-filtration tool</a>.<br/>
           </br></br>
          Here's what you need to get connected to cryptostorm:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your token is all you use to connect to cryptostorm.
           There's no "account" &amp; no extra info. Don't lose your token, as we can't replace it -
           we delete records of sold tokens, permanently. No need to start using your token right away;
           it won't begin 'eroding' towards expiration until you auth into cryptostorm the first time.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows folks most often use our <a href="http://cryptostorm.download">opensource widget</a> to connect to cryptostorm.
          The widget automates cryptostorm connections, and it protects against <a href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=2778">DNS leaks</a>, <a href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=8549">webRTC IP leak bug</a>, and more.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/cryptostorm/cryptostorm_client_configuration_files/tree/master/mac">Connection profiles</a> for Mac folks (<a href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=9005">Tunnelbiick and Viscosity</a> supported) are maintained in our <a href="https://github.com/cryptostorm">github repository</a>.
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/cryptostorm/cryptostorm_client_configuration_files/tree/master/linux">config files</a> for Linux distros are also found in our <a href="https://github.com/cryptostorm/cryptostorm_client_configuration_files">config repository</a>.
          Beyond those, we support a vast range of OSes, platforms, and hardware routers; howto guides are collected in our <a href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewforum.php?f=37">discussion forum</a>, and are actively maintained and expanded by our member community.<br>
          <br>

          Our <a  href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewforum.php?f=32">member  support subforum</a> is a great place to look for quick fixes to common hiccups, &amp; even esoteric topics often find expert advice there.</br>

          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor speeds, spotty connections, or frequent drops are not something you should accept as 'normal' whilst on-cstorm!
          If you have those issues, please do get in touch &amp; we'll figure out what's going on.</br>

          We take <a href="https://cryptostorm.org/viewtopic.php?f=51&amp;t=6083">network performance</a> very seriously - help us keep improving by reporting problems, slowness, or any other performance sadness.<br>
          <br>
